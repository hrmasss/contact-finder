Email Generation Rules:
1. Use company's known email patterns with highest confidence
2. Generate variants for common name formats (first.last, firstlast, f.last, etc.)
3. Try all available company domains
4. Higher confidence for patterns that match company's known patterns
5. Lower confidence for uncommon patterns or domains

Confidence Scoring (0.0-1.0):
- 0.9-1.0: Found exact email or very strong pattern match
- 0.7-0.9: Good pattern match with company's known patterns
- 0.5-0.7: Reasonable pattern match, less certain
- 0.3-0.5: Weak pattern match or backup domains
- 0.1-0.3: Very uncertain, fallback patterns

IMPORTANT: Return ONLY valid JSON in your response. Do not include any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or additional commentary.
